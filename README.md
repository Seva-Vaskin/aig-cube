# aig-cube: Adapting Cube-and-Conquer to CircuitSAT

This repository serves as the official supplementary archive for our paper submitted to the **MIPRO 2026** conference (AIS Track). It provides the experimental framework and data necessary to reproduce the results of our circuit-aware Cube approach.

The repository is currently a **placeholder**. By late February 2026, we will upload the full source code for the `aig-cube` tool, which operates natively on And-Inverter Graphs (AIG), along with the suite multiplier miter benchmarks used in our evaluation.

### Key Materials (Coming Soon)
* **Source Code:** AIG-native lookahead engine and gate-level substitution rules.
* **Benchmarks:** Challenging multiplier miters (Dadda, Wallace, Karatsuba, Column).
